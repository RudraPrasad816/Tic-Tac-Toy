6.About This Game:
    1.  This is a two player game.
    2. There will be 9 divisions in this game and players have to choose their divisions(one at a time) by marking "X" or "O" on it by clicking their divisions.

    3.  Aim of this game is to choose 3 divisions in a line with same mark(i.e both players should try to make a line). The line could be horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

    4.  Once a player choose a division then the divisions mark can not be changed i.e this division will no longer be clickable.

    5.  when ever a player make a line (either vertically, horizontally or diagonally) the game will be over showing a message that partically player has won and the game table will be no longer clickable.

    6.  If the same players continue playing this game again then this time the second player has to start the game by choosing a division.

7.Procedure To Develope This Game:
    1.  Create a project file in VisualStudioCode

    2.  Create a HTML file a css file and a js file (you can also use embeded but external is good to use that your html, style and script part will be organize)

    3.  Use boiler plate code in html for head part or write the code and link both the style and script file in the head and end of the body part respectively.

    4.  create 2 sections where first section is to get the name of two players and the second is for the game part

    5.  In the first section make a form and use two input tags with type "text"; And create a button using button tag with value Play.

    6.  Style the first section with height 100vh and give some margin padding and other styles to the inputs and button to make the section look good.

    7.  Make the second section hidden by using a css property display "none" to make this session invisible at first.

    8.  In the second section create a h1 tag which initially show game will start when player one choose a division. and latter it will show players turn through js.

    9.  create a division in which there will be 9 divisions in which players will play by clicking on their turn.
